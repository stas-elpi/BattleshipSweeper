# BattleshipSweeper game

## Members:  Elpida Stasinou, Dimitris Tzovanis

This game coded in c++ is a hybrid of the two known games: Battleship and Minesweeper.

How to play:
- Below tiles, that cover the entire board, there are hidden ships and mines. You have to click on tiles to remove them, to uncover the ships while avoiding the mines.
- There are numbers that display the amount of mines that are around them (just like Minesweeper), to help the player avoid them.
- the ships are split into parts (the same way they are in Battleship)
- Find all ships while avoiding the mines to win.
